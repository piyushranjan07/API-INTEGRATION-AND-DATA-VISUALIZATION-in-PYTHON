*DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT*: As part of my Python internship at CODTECH, the first task assigned was to create a Python-based solution that fetches real-time data from a public API and visualizes it using plotting libraries like matplotlib or seaborn. This task aimed to evaluate practical understanding of working with APIs, data handling, and visualization techniques—skills that are fundamental for modern data-driven applications. I used Visual Studio Code (VS Code) as the development environment throughout this task due to its flexibility, extensions, and built-in terminalThe objective of this task was to access data from an external public API, specifically OpenWeatherMap, and then present that data in a graphical format. OpenWeatherMap provides a variety of weather data such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc., in real-time through its freely available API. To begin with, I registered on the OpenWeatherMap platform to obtain a personal API key. This key is essential for authenticating my requests to the API.After acquiring the key, I used the requests library in Python to interact with the API. This involved crafting a URL that included the endpoint, query parameters like city name (Delhi, in my case), units in metric form, and the API key. By sending an HTTP GET request to the OpenWeatherMap forecast API endpoint, I was able to retrieve a JSON response containing the 5-day weather forecast with data at 3-hour intervals. Next, I parsed the JSON response to extract two main components—temperature and time—from each forecasted entry. To manage and organize this data, I used Python lists, appending each temperature and its corresponding timestamp as I iterated through the API response. A crucial part of this step was to verify that the key 'list' existed in the response dictionary, as failure to include this check could result in a runtime KeyError if the API call was unsuccessful (for example, due to an invalid API key or incorrect city name). For the visualization aspect, I used the matplotlib.pyplot library to generate a line graph showing temperature trends over time. This visual representation makes it easier to observe fluctuations and patterns in the weather forecast. I limited the visualization to the first 10 forecast entries for better readability and used functions like plt.xticks(rotation=45) to rotate the x-axis labels, ensuring they don't overlap. The plot included a title, axis labels, and was neatly formatted using plt.tight_layout(). The entire script was developed and executed in VS Code, which provided a smooth workflow. The integrated terminal allowed me to install necessary Python packages using pip and run my script without switching windows. The VS Code environment also helped with syntax highlighting, code formatting, and debugging. Moreover, I used the built-in Python extension, which offered linting, autocompletion, and Jupyter-like code insights, making the development process efficient and enjoyable. Overall, this task was an excellent opportunity to apply theoretical knowledge in a practical context. It reinforced my understanding of APIs, JSON data structures, HTTP requests, and data visualization techniques. I also became more comfortable using an IDE like VS Code for Python development. Successfully completing this task gave me a strong foundation in integrating external data sources and visualizing real-time data, which are highly valued skills in data science, web development, and automation projects.
